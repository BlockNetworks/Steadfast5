## Introduction

Steadfast3 is a project for backporting new Minecraft: Pocket Edition changes to older Pocketmine versions for better stability and performance, while retaining as many features from the new PocketMine-MP versions as possible.

## Todo-List

- [x] Forms
- [ ] Add items and blocks
- [x] addTitle function
- [ ] Api updates
- [ ] And more

## Known bugs

- Players don't fall out of the world naturally, you'll want to handle PlayerMoveEvent as needed to kill them.
